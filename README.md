# MovieDB API App

##Description 

This project is based on the one at: https://github.com/lillylangtree/mdb-initial.git

This project is a initial version of a student project used for
learning the AngularJS frame work.

It uses the MoviesDB Api as its basis see http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#

##Launching it locally

To clone the application use the usual git clone command from a command tool

1. `https://github.com/juanmaguitar/angular-moviedb-api.git`
2. the clone will create a `angular-moviedb-api` folder in the current folder

The application includes a `package.json` file which will allow you to run a 
local http server. You need to have npm installed to do this.

    >> cd angular-moviedb-api
    >> npm start

After this, in a browser navigate to `localhost:8000` (you can change the port setting in the `package.json` file if you wish) and the home page should appear

If you don't have npm installed you can still run the application just
copy the main folder to where your files get served from locally
